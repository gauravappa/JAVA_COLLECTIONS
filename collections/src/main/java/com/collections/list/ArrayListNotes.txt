ArrayList is a resizable arrays
which implements List interface.

Example : Consider you have array of size 10
			int a[]=new int[10];
			
			you can store 10 elements in arrays from index 0 to 9
			a[0]=1;
			a[1]=2;
			.
			.
			.
			a[9]=10
			
			but if we want to add another element which is 11th element
			then we cannot because if we do it will throw array index out of bound exception
			
			a[10]=1; this line will throw out of bound exception
			
			therefore we needed data structure that can change its size depending on requirement
			therefore dynamic arrays comes into picture so called arraylist.
